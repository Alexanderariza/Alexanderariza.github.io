RedLaTIF network
------
Is a regional network established in 2002 under the Global Observations of Forest and Land Dynamics (GOFC/GOLD)-Fire Mapping and Monitoring Theme. [RedLaTIF](https://gofcgold.org/regional-networks/red-latinoamerica-deteledeteccion-e-incendios-forestales-redlatif), the network provides opportunities and support to promote the use of remote sensing data and to bridge the gap between end users and space agencies. This year 2020, the network is leading the promotion of a new remote sensing training project, for specialists with an emphasis on the detection and mapping of active fires and burned areas on the use of the Google Earth Engine platform. If you are interested to join, you can fill in this [form](https://forms.gle/wSQGMQLXcWv9u2NY9) or [reach out](mailto:nicolasalejandromari@gmail.com) to us, if you would like to discuss something else.


NGO Glocal LifeLearn e.V.
------
I am a co-founder and currently the 1st board member of the German-based NGO [Glocal LifeLearn e.V.](https://www.glocal-lifelearn.org). We are supporting education initiatives worldwide, aiming to give disadvantaged children access to education. In the last ten years, we established an educational sponsorship program together with the Bukedea Lifeline Schools in East Uganda. We currently give 62 disadvantaged children the opportunity to receive a good education by paying their school fees and school uniform.<br>
In 2019, we received a grant of 25.000 Euro from the Germany Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development in order to establish a training centre for nurses and midwifes in Bukedea, together with the Bukedea Lifeline Schools.
