<br>.
------
Is a regional network established in 2002 under the Global Observations of Forest and Land Dynamics (GOFC/GOLD)-Fire Mapping and Monitoring Theme. [RedLaTIF](https://gofcgold.org/regional-networks/red-latinoamerica-deteledeteccion-e-incendios-forestales-redlatif), the network provides opportunities and support to promote the use of remote sensing data and to bridge the gap between end users and space agencies. This year 2020, the network is leading the promotion of a new **remote sensing training** project, for specialists with an emphasis on the detection and mapping of active fires and burned areas on the use of the Google Earth Engine platform. If you are interested to join, you can fill in this [form](https://forms.gle/wSQGMQLXcWv9u2NY9) or [reach out](mailto:nicolasalejandromari@gmail.com, alexanderariza@gmail.com) to us, if you would like to discuss something else.


Sortzen-Geo Iniciative
------
I am a co-founder and currently member of the German-based NGO [Sortzen-Geo](https://alexanderariza.github.io/sortzen.geo.github.io/). We will work toward the sustained availability of satellite and ground observations, as well as other sources of data and information in support of Disaster Risk Reduction and management. The ultimate goal of this proposed Synergy Framework is to support countries all over the world towards a sustainable process to address their DRR requirements.<br>
A number of partners involved on a global scale in space technologies want to reaffirm their strong interest in addressing synergies to better respond to the requirements established in the post-2020 framework.
