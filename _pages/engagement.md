Wildfires management training in Google Earth Engine platform - GEE
------
<br/><img src='/images/training_.PNG'>

Is a regional network established in 2002 under the Global Observations of Forest and Land Dynamics (GOFC/GOLD)-Fire Mapping and Monitoring Theme. [RedLaTIF](https://gofcgold.org/regional-networks/red-latinoamerica-deteledeteccion-e-incendios-forestales-redlatif), the network provides opportunities and support to promote the use of remote sensing data and to bridge the gap between end users and space agencies. This year 2020, with the support of the [UN-SPIDER](https://un-spider.org/), the Friends of Nature Foundation [FAN](http://www.fan-bo.org/), National Institute of Agricultural Technology [INTA](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/inta) and the Institute for Higher Space Studies [Mario Gulich](https://ig.conae.unc.edu.ar/), the network is leading the promotion of a new [**remote sensing training**](https://ig.conae.unc.edu.ar/taller-gestion-de-incendios-forestales-mediante-el-uso-de-la-plataforma-google-earth-engine-gee/) project, for specialists with an emphasis on the detection and mapping of active fires and burned areas on the use of the **Google Earth Engine - GEE** platform.

The landslide and mass removal processes that occurred in the southern area of the state of Oaxaca in 2020 were analyzed for the area of La Soledad using Sentinel-2 optical imagery, radar image analysis and digital terrain models (DTM). A specific algorithm was developed to establish a model for automatic extraction of the traces of the ground movements by using the Bare Soil Index (BSI) at two different times. See the post on [Mediun](https://alexanderariza.medium.com/landslide-detection-for-rapid-mapping-using-sentinel-2-622033d4ce21).<br>
The results allow us to extract the shapes of the landslides in the terrain and to calculate their direction, this methodology allows extracting and characterizing landslides processes from Sentinel-2 satellite images. The [algorithm](https://custom-scripts.sentinel-hub.com/sentinel-2/landslide_detection_rapid_mapping/) is part of Custom Script Contest‚Äù of the COPERNICUS program by the European Space Agency - ESA), in coordination with the European Commission, managed by the Euro Data Cube group.

GEDI project and Forest fire susceptibility
------
<br/><img src='/images/img_GEDI.png'>

The new Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation [GEDI](https://gedi.umd.edu/) launched on December 5th, 2018 is operating onboard the International Space Station [ISS](https://spotthestation.nasa.gov/) producing a high-resolution laser collecting 3D data around Earth on forest canopy height, canopy vertical structure, and surface elevation. We work on the evaluation of a new method that has been applied for forest fire susceptibility mapping GEDI data based. The results of the analysis were verified using forest fire location data with the help of a new the library pyGEDI is developed in Python as it can utilize multiple CPUs, GPUs, and is supported by C and [GDAL](https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal) and GEE.

IO-Star Iniciative
------
<br/><img src='/images/IO_STAR.JPG'>

I am a co-founder and currently member of the NGO based [IO-Star](https://alexanderariza.github.io/sortzen.geo.github.io/). We will work toward the sustained availability of satellite and ground observations, as well as other sources of data and information in support of Disaster Risk Reduction and management. The ultimate goal of this proposed Synergy Framework is to support countries all over the world towards a sustainable process to address their DRR requirements.<br>
A number of partners involved on a global scale in space technologies want to reaffirm their strong interest in addressing synergies to better respond to the requirements established in the post-2020 framework.
