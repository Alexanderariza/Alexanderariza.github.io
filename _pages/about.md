Hi, I am Alexander and I am a <font color='#173cd6'>geospatial data searcher, PhD . Geographic Information Technologies </font> on a mission to make data from open remote sensors more accessible. My work is on the applicability of research between data users and data providers. I strongly believe in leveraging open source geospatial software and bringing together different Earth Science communities to make the most of open geospatial data.<br>
You can find me on [Researchgate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alexander_Ariza2), [GitHub](https://github.com/Alexanderariza) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-ariza).

- Geospatial data searcher
------
I do research, techening and consultancy work on open geospatial data and software on Geo-information and remote sensing, Physical Geography, Environmental Sciences, Geomatic applied to Risk Management. [workshops](/talks), mainly on interactive (geo-)spatial data analysis, with Jupyter notebooks, Python and R.<br>
Projects I have been working on recently:<br>
  - *Main developer and content lead* - [Forest fire monitoring on GEE (RedLatif)](http://incendios.fan-bo.org/Satrifo/) programme, an online coding programme to develop Forest Fire-related open-source software.<br>
  - *Visiting Scientist and content support* - [**Recommended Practices development**](http://www.un-spider.org/advisory-support/recommended-practices), a series of procediments using space technologies for disaster risk management and emergency response, including Landsat, Sentinel-5p, Sentinel-3, GOME-2, IASI and CAMS. *(in collaboration with <a href="http://www.un-spider.org/">UN-SPIDER</a> and <a href="https://www.unoosa.org/" target="_blank">ONOOSA</a>)*<br>
  - *Developer* - [**Development of practical tutorials and How-To Guides**](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/toolbox/doc/index.html) for <a href="https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/" target="_blank">Copernicus Climate Data Store Toolbox</a>. *(in collaboration with <a href="http://www.bopen.it/" target="_blank">B-Open Solutions</a>, <a href="http://sabrinaszeto.com/" target="_blank">Sabrina Szeto Consulting</a> and EJR-Quartz)*<br>
  - *Main developer and project lead* - [ERA5 in Google Earth Engine](https://github.com/jwagemann/era5_in_gee), to make a subset of the Copernicus climate reanalysis [ERA5 dataset](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview) available as part of <a href="https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/ECMWF_ERA5_DAILY" target="__blank">Google Earth Engine's public data catalog</a>.

- PhD research
------
I finished a [PhD at the Faculty of Geography at University of Alcal√° , Alcala de Henares, Madrid](https://geogra.uah.es/?phase=1&subpage=aims&subprojectid=1013), in collaboration with [GITA research Grup](https://geogra.uah.es/gita/) and [Earth Observation Group for the Quantitative Dynamics of the Biosphere](http://www.upm.es/observatorio/vi/index.jsp?pageac=grupo.jsp&idGrupo=640) of (Polytechnic University of Madrid](https://www.upm.es/),. My research focuses on analysis of changes in the structure of the landscape by forest fires by detection, and how we can support this with the Big Data technologies, and cloud computing. I am interested in how big data technologies like GEE or JS can be leveraged to provide efficient cloud geospatial data services
It is a methodology.
