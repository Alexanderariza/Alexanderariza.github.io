Hi, I am Alexander and I am a <font color='#173cd6'>geospatial data searcher, PhD . Geographic Information Technologies </font> on a mission to make data from open remote sensors more accessible. My work is on the applicability of research between data users and data providers. I strongly believe in leveraging open source geospatial software and bringing together different Earth Science communities to make the most of open geospatial data.<br>
You can find me on [Researchgate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alexander_Ariza2), [GitHub](https://github.com/Alexanderariza) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-ariza).

- Geospatial data analysis
------
I do research, techening and consultancy work on open geospatial data and software on Geo-information and remote sensing, Physical Geography, Environmental Sciences, Geomatic applied to Risk Management. [workshops](/talks), mainly on interactive Geospatial data analysis, with Jupyter notebooks, Python and R.<br>
Projects I have been working on recently:<br>
  - *Main developer and content lead* - [**Forest fire monitoring on GEE**](http://incendios.fan-bo.org/Satrifo/), training programme of [RedLatif](https://gofcgold.org/regional-networks/red-latinoamerica-deteledeteccion-e-incendios-forestales-redlatif) and [FAN Fundation](http://www.fan-bo.org/), an online coding programme to develop Forest Fire-related open-source software.<br>
  - *Visiting Scientist and content support* - [**Recommended Practices development**](http://www.un-spider.org/advisory-support/recommended-practices), a series of procediments using space technologies for disaster risk management and emergency response, including Landsat, MODIS, Sentinel-5p, Sentinel-3, GOME-2, IASI and PROBA-V data. *(in collaboration with <a href="http://www.un-spider.org/">UN-SPIDER</a> and <a href="https://www.unoosa.org/" target="_blank">ONOOSA.</a>)*<br>
  - *Main developer and project lead* - **Development of practical tutorials and How-To Guides** for Thematic and Digital Cartography, in the Master in Geography of [UPTC](http://www.uptc.edu.co/facultades/f_educacion/maestria/geograf/inf_general/index.html).
  - *CAL/Val Team* - [**FAC Satellite Capabilities in Antarctica**](https://www.fac.mil.co/facsat-1-un-a%C3%B1o-en-el-espacio), the research project for Calibration of Optical Systems Cubesat: Factsat-1 that responsible for calibrating optical spectrometer systems at the Earth Observation Center group of [AIr Force of Colombia - FAC](https://www.fac.mil.co/). *(in collaboration with <a href="https://ciaf.igac.gov.co/">CIAF</a> and <a href="https://minciencias.gov.co/">MINCIENCIAS.</a>)*<br>

- PhD research
------
I finished a [PhD at the Faculty of Geography at University of Alcal√° , Alcala de Henares, Madrid](https://geogra.uah.es/?phase=1&subpage=aims&subprojectid=1013), in collaboration with [GITA research Grup](https://geogra.uah.es/gita/) and [Earth Observation Group for the Quantitative Dynamics of the Biosphere](http://www.upm.es/observatorio/vi/index.jsp?pageac=grupo.jsp&idGrupo=640) of [Polytechnic University of Madrid](https://www.upm.es/),. My research focuses on analysis of changes in the structure of the landscape by forest fires by detection, and how we can support this with the Big Data technologies, and cloud computing. I am interested in how big data technologies like Google Earth Engine or Sentinel Playground can be leveraged to provide efficient cloud geospatial data services
it is a methodology.

- Research and projects
------
  - *FOREST FIRES ON GEE GEEMAP* - [Jupyter short course 2020](https://github.com/Alexanderariza/FOREST-FIRES-ON-GEE-GEEMAP). A basic scripts collection explained in Spanish for digital image processing using various Python packages, including Earth Engine Python API, folium, ipyleaflet, and geemap. Explained interactively on Jupyter notebooks, in order to be able to work with data in bulk in the cloud using open source software, as an alternative to proprietary desktop software. Developed as part of the support material for the [Regional support RSO](http://kp.un-spider.org/network/regional-support-offices) offices of the UN-SPIDER program.
  - *Member* - [The Latin-American Network for Remote Sensing and Forest Fires (RedLaTIF)](https://gofcgold.org/regional-networks/red-latinoamerica-deteledeteccion-e-incendios-forestales-redlatif) -  is a regional network established in 2002 under the Global Observations of Forest and Land Dynamics (GOFC/GOLD)-Fire Mapping and Monitoring Theme. 
  - *Co-Founder* - [sortzen.geo](https://alexanderariza.github.io/sortzen.geo.github.io/) - Launched in 2020, sortzen.geo initiative that seeks to promote and bring the use of geospatial technology to the solution of global problems. Is a technology-based initiative specialized in data processing and satellite images for hydrology, water quality, environmental assessment, and land cover mapping, among other services. Sortzen-Geo handles the entire data flow from receipt, satellite image processing to delivery of final products. [Join us!](bit.ly/womeningeospatial_sig)
