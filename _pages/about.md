Hi, I am Alexander and I am a <font color='#173cd6'>geospatial data searcher, PhD . Geographic Information Technologies </font> on a mission to make data from open remote sensors more accessible. My work is on the applicability of research between data users and data providers. I strongly believe in leveraging open source geospatial software and bringing together different Earth Science communities to make the most of open geospatial data.<br>
You can find me on [Researchgate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alexander_Ariza2), [GitHub](https://github.com/Alexanderariza) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-ariza).

- Geospatial data searcher
------
I do research, techening and consultancy work on open geospatial data and software on Geo-information and remote sensing, Physical Geography, Environmental Sciences, Geomatic applied to Risk Management. [workshops](/talks), mainly on interactive (geo-)spatial data analysis, with Jupyter notebooks, Python and R.<br>
Projects I have been working on recently:<br>
  - *Main developer and content lead* - [Forest fire monitoring on GEE (RedLatif)](http://incendios.fan-bo.org/Satrifo/) programme, an online coding programme to develop Forest Fire-related open-source software.<br>
  - *Visiting Scientist and content support* - [**Recommended Practices development**](http://www.un-spider.org/advisory-support/recommended-practices), a series of procediments using space technologies for disaster risk management and emergency response, including Landsat, Sentinel-5p, Sentinel-3, GOME-2, IASI and CAMS. *(in collaboration with <a href="http://www.un-spider.org/">UN-SPIDER</a> and <a href="https://www.unoosa.org/" target="_blank">ONOOSA s.r.l.</a>)*<br>
  - *Developer* - [**Development of practical tutorials and How-To Guides**](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/toolbox/doc/index.html) for <a href="https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/" target="_blank">Copernicus Climate Data Store Toolbox</a>. *(in collaboration with <a href="http://www.bopen.it/" target="_blank">B-Open Solutions</a>, <a href="http://sabrinaszeto.com/" target="_blank">Sabrina Szeto Consulting</a> and EJR-Quartz)*<br>
  - *Main developer and project lead* - [ERA5 in Google Earth Engine](https://github.com/jwagemann/era5_in_gee), to make a subset of the Copernicus climate reanalysis [ERA5 dataset](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview) available as part of <a href="https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/ECMWF_ERA5_DAILY" target="__blank">Google Earth Engine's public data catalog</a>.

- PhD research
------
I pursue a [PhD at the Faculty of Geography at University of Marburg](http://vhrz669.hrz.uni-marburg.de/lcrs/content_subprojects.do?phase=1&subpage=aims&subprojectid=1013), in collaboration with ECMWF. My research is in the interface of open climate and meteorological data, user requirements, Big data technologies and cloud computing. I am interested how big data technologies, such as Apache Spark or Dask, can be leveraged in order to provide efficient geospatial data services on the cloud.
